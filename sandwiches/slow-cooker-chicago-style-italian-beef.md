# Notes: 
- Servings: ~6 sandwiches
- Prep time: 15m, mostly waiting for the broth to boil
- Cook time: 8-10 hours in medium, 10-12 hours on low
  * I almost always do 9-10 hours on medium slow cook in the instant pot and it comes out perfect

# Ingredients:
- 4 cups (32 oz.) beef stock
- 2.5 lb chuck roast (or similar)
- 1 whole onion, sliced
- 1 green pepper, sliced
- 2 0.6oz packets zesty italian dressing mix
- 2 tsp garlic powder
- 1 tsp cayenne red pepper
- 1 tsp black pepper
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp dried dill
- 1 tsp oregano
- 1 tsp basil
- 1 tsp parsley
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 tsp Better Than Bouillon - Beef
- hoagie rolls (or similar)
- sliced provologne cheese
- pepperoncini peppers

# Instructions:
1. Add beef stock to sauce pot on medium heat
2. Stir in Better than Bouillon
3. Add dried seasonings (italian mix, garlic, cayenne, black pepper, salt, dill, oregano, basil, parsley, bay leaf), mixing well
4. Bring mixture to a boil, then remove from heat
5. Add chuck roast to slow cooker
6. Pour hot mixture over chuck roast
7. Cover and slow cook (timing in Notes section)
8. When there are about 2 hours (3 on low) remaining, add the sliced onions and peppers
9. When there is about an hour (2 on low) remaining, remove the chuck roast, shred it, and return the shredded beef to the slow cooker
10. If desired, add pepperoncini peppers (and/or juice) to the slow cooker after shredding the beef)
11. When beef is done, prepare beef on toasted hoagie rolls
12. Recommend adding pepperoncini peppers under sliced provologne cheese, and warming under a broiler for 1-2 minutes

# Options:
- Instead of cooking the peppers and onions in the pot, you can choose to saute them at the end and add directly to the sandwiches
- Better Than Bouillon can be replaced with 2 cubes beef bouillon
- Mozzarella cheese works well in place of provologne
- Use a small bowl of au jus to dip the sandwich in
- Add mayo to the toasted rolls before adding the beef
