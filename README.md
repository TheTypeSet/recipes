# recipes
A collection of all the best recipes that git can provide... eventually.

# concept
A recipe is the source code of a meal. This code, often combined with other code within various levels of distributed food-and-drink-based systems, can be executed on most humanocentric biological machines.

# requirements
All meal source code within this project must be capable of running on a standard model homo sapien.
