# Notes: 
- Heat, salt, and sweetness preferences vary; adjust sugar and salt, and/or add ground cayenne as preferred
- You should really, really buy your curry paste at an asian food market or similar; the cost per oz can be insane at regular grocery stores

5. Add 1 tbsp of cooking oil
6. Add 1 whole diced red onion, 2 tsp crushed ginger, 2 tsp lemongrass paste, and 3 tsp minced garlic
7. Saute for 3-4 minutes until onions soften; careful to not burn
