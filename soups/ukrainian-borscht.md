# Notes: 
- Servings: 10+ bowls (about 7 quarts)
- Prep time will depend on how long it takes you to prep the veggies, but I try to budget at least 30 minutes
- Cook time will somewhat depend on your stove, altitude, etc., but I normally budget about 90 minutes

# Ingredients:

# Options:
- When inherited, recipe called for bone-in pork country ribs; using these doesn't change a whole lot in the taste, but can be cheaper than the chicken
- If you don't have any fresh dill, just add 2 more tsp of dried dill as part of step 6
