# Notes: 
- Servings: 10+ bowls (about 7 quarts)
- Prep time will depend on how long it takes you to prep the veggies, but I try to budget at least 30 minutes
- Cook time will somewhat depend on your stove, altitude, etc., but I normally budget about 90 minutes

9. Add Better Than Bouillion
10. Cover again and return to a simmer

21. Stir soup-cream mixture back into the pot
22. Serve with buttered rye bread; add extra sour cream to taste

# Options:
- When inherited, recipe called for bone-in pork country ribs; using these doesn't change a whole lot in the taste, but can be cheaper than the chicken
- You can remove the chicken, remove the sour cream, and sub vegetable base Better Than Bouillion to make a vegetarian version, and it's still really good
- If you don't have any fresh dill, just add 2 more tsp of dried dill as part of step 8
