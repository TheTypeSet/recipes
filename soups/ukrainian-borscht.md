# Notes: 
- Servings: 10+ bowls (about 7 quarts)
- Prep time will depend on how long it takes you to prep the veggies, but I try to budget at least 30 minutes
- Cook time will somewhat depend on your stove, altitude, etc., but I normally budget about 90 minutes
  * The first 30 minutes or so can overlap with your prep as you cook the pork
