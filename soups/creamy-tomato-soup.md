# Notes: 
- Servings: ~8 bowls
- Prep time will depend on how long it takes you to prep the veggies, but I try to budget at least 15 minutes
- Cook time will somewhat depend on your stove, altitude, etc., but I normally budget about 60 minutes
- Great with grilled cheese, salad, or similar
- If possible, use a pot that doesn't have an interior coating (such as nonstick or enamel)
- Having an immersion blender makes this easier
- You need a nonreactive pot or dutch oven for this recipe
