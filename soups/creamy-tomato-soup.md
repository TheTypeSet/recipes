# Notes: 
- Servings: ~8 bowls
- Prep time will depend on how long it takes you to prep the veggies, but I try to budget at least 15 minutes
- Cook time will somewhat depend on your stove, altitude, etc., but I normally budget about 60 minutes
- Great with grilled cheese, salad, or similar
- If possible, use a pot that doesn't have an interior coating (such as nonstick or enamel)
- Having an immersion blender makes this easier
- You need a nonreactive pot or dutch oven for this recipe

# Ingredients:
- 4 tbsp butter
- 2 onions (3 cups), diced 
- 6 cloves garlic (3 tbsp), minced
- 56 oz San Marzano tomatoes, crushed or similar 
- 1 qt (32 oz.) chicken stock
- 2 tbsp Better Than Bouillon - Chicken
- 1 cup (8 oz) fresh basil, chopped
- 3 tbsp sugar
- 1 tsp black pepper
- 1 pt (16 oz) heavy whipping cream
- 1 cup (8 oz) parmesan, grated

# Instructions:
1. Preheat large (nonreactive) pot over medium heat
2. Add butter and onions
3. Saute for 6 minutes, stirring often (onions should be softened and getting golden)
4. Add minced garlic
5. Continue to saute for 2 minutes, stirring
6. Stir in tomatoes (include the juice in the can), chicken stock, Better than Bouillon, half (0.5 cup) of the chopped basil, sugar, and pepper
7. Mix well, return to a simmer
8. Partially cover, reduce heat to low, and let simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally
9. Remove from heat and blend soup; this is best done with an immersion blender, but can also be done by scooping batch at a time into a regular blender
10. Once all soup is blended, return to low heat

# Options:
- Sweet, vidalia, and/or yellow onions all work; white onions will give the soup a more oniony flavour
