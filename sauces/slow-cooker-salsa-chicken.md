# Notes: 
- Makes 6+ servings
- Prep Time: 5 minutes
- Slow Cooking Time: 8-9 hours on medium, 11-12 hours on low
  * I almost always do ~9 hours on slow cook medium in the instant pot
- Usually serve on top of brown rice

# Ingredients:
- 1.5 lb boneless skinless chicken thighs (thawed if frozen)
- 24 oz jar of salsa
- 22.6 oz can cream of chicken soup
- 2 tbsp Better than Bouillon Chicken Base
- brown rice
- shredded colby jack cheese
- sour cream
- sliced jalapenos
- cholula hot sauce (or similar)

# Instructions:
1. Pat dry chicken thighs
2. Add chicken breasts, salsa, and cream of chicken soup to slow cooker
3. Cook following the temps/times shown in the Notes section
4. Starting halfway through the cook time, start stirring occasionally
5. When there are about 2 hours remaining, add the Better than Bouillon, stir, and use a potato masher (or similar) to shred the chicken in the slow cooker
6. Serve over fresh cooked brown rice
7. Top with shredded colby jack, sour cream, sliced jalapenos, and cholula to taste

# Options:
- Usually use medium pace picante salsa, but any fairly thick and flavorful salsa should work
  * Recommend against fruit-flavored salsas (and similar)
- With the minimal ingredients, you can ziploc and freeze several batches of this at once
  * When you want to cook it, just put it in the fridge to thaw the night before, and dump into the slow cooker in the morning
